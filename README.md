# Anime List
My personal list of watched anime that I have reviewed.

## About
Currently, this project is for a Udemy class I'm working through, learning Node and Express. This is my first deep dive into back-end web development and RESTful APIs.

I'd like to eventually create a nice front-end to go with it where I can add new entries to the list or edit existing entries. For now though, I'm only focusing on honing my back-end skills through this project.
